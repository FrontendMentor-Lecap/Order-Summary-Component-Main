## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenged I practiced flexbox and widths. By assigning different widths to parent elements I can control the aspect of the whole section or card.
I also practiced active states with the `:hover` selector in the `<a>` and the button.

### Continued development

I would like to improve with `::before` and `::after` pseudo selectors, to place images or icons around another item.
